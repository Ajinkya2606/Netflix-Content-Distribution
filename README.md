📊 Netflix Content Strategy Analysis with Python
Analyze Netflix’s content strategy using Python and uncover insights into genre trends, release patterns, international expansions, and more.

📌 Project Overview
This project dives into Netflix's content library to explore how the streaming giant has evolved its content strategy. We use Python for data analysis and visualization to answer questions like:

What types of content (Movies vs. TV Shows) are added most frequently?

How has Netflix’s focus changed over time?

Which countries are producing the most Netflix content?

What are the most common genres on Netflix?

Are there seasonal trends in content release?

🗂️ Dataset
We use the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset from Kaggle, which contains details about titles available on Netflix till 2021 (you can add more recent data if available).
